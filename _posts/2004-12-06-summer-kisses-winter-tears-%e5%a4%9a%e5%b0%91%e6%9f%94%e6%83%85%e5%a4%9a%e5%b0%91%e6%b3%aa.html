猫王的经典老歌，我就不多说了，回忆一下吧～！
----------------------------------------------
歌词：
Summer kisses winter tears
That was what she gave to you
Never thoug I'd travel all alone
With dream of memories
Happy hour was all we know
But I guess I can't complain
For I still recall the summer song
Thongh all the wanderings
The fire of love the fire of love
Can burn from atar
And nothing can light the dark of night
Like the stars they fade away

Summer kisses winter tears
Like the stars they fade away
Leving me to spend my lonely night
With dreams of yesterday
The fire of love the fire of love
Can burn from atar
And nothing can light the dark of night
Like the stars they fade away
<!--more-->
Summer kisses winter tears
Like the stars they fade away
Leving me to spend my lonely night
With dreams of yesterday

Leving me to spend my lonely night
With dreams of yesterday

Summer kisses winter tears
