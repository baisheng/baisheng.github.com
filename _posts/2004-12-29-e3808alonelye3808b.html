风格：R&B+Hip-Hop 
演唱：NANA 
来自于非洲加纳的NANA出身于一个富有的家庭，但是父亲在他小时候离他们而去，母亲带着年幼的NANA定居到了德国。肤色的歧视，家庭的破碎，使得 NANA从小就在压抑的环境中生存。这首LONELY是他最有名的作品，也是最感人的作品之一。在这首歌曲中，爱情的失败，世事的的无奈，人与人之间的勾心斗角，都被他赤裸裸的展露在你面前。动情处的伤心呐喊，颓废时的无奈低吟，节奏布鲁斯，跳舞音乐，HIP HOP结合的天衣无缝。<!--more-->

歌词： 

I'm alone 
I am lonely lonely lonely 
I am lonely lonely in my life 
I am lonely lonely lonely 
God help me help me to survive! 
Bridge 
Remember first time we met day one 
Kids in the garden' playin' games heaven' fun 
Excitin' and amazin' havin' a real friend of mine 
Face to face and eye to eye 
Usin' our hands to buy and supply 
Chillin' is cool from January to June 
And we still stiked together like the glue 
And know the rules 
Forever you and I and believe it was clear 
If I ever should fall I could count on you with no fear 
Runnin' out of time I see who's fake 
Alone without protection from all them snakes 
All for one one for all I was told 
Black white yellow no matter if your young or old 
Nana's in the house to let you know 
What I see is how I feel and damn 
I'm alone 
I am lonely lonely lonely 
I am lonely lonely in my life 
I am lonely lonely lonely 
God help me help me to survive! 
Bridge 
Everybody's trippin' on me 
Oh lord come help me please 
I did some bad things in my life 
Why can't you rescue me 'cause you've got all I need 
I know I got to pay the price 
Lonely (2x) 
Cheepin' thru the streets at night after a fuss and fight 
Tears in my eyes I'm a man lookin' for the light 
Dark is the path I know he will rescue me 
The lord is my shephard I'm cool despite emergency 
Whom shall I fear exept the god 
Thank you for the blessin' and the skils on the mic 
Five years we know there's no diggity 
Free at last see the light in me 
What goes up must come down 
I'll be around while you heading towards deathtown 
Always look forward hardly never look back 
So many tears and the snakes on my jock 
Now I'm riding in my big fat ride 
Your ass is late so look for the line 
Nana in the house to let you know 
What I see is how I feel so leave me alone 
Lonely (3x) 
Knock on my door whom you lookin' for 
A dream or reality enemies at my door 
Eyes I realize it's fantasize I must be high 
So let me live before I die 
Once again grab the bottle twist the cap 
To survive your life is yours my life is mine 
No emotions in this world full of lies 
Step my step and be versatile 
Love peace and crash that's what it's all about 
Alone by yourself than you lack there's no doubt about 
I'm always into something making moves to improve 
What would you do if you where in my shoes 
Boom a letter oops another suicide 
Meet me for a ride at the boulevard 
Nana's in the house to let you know 
What I see is how I feel and damn </embed>
